His studio, filled with bright canvases and cheerful colors, contrasted sharply with his dimly lit apartment, where he spent his nights in contemplation and despair.", "answer": "Situational irony", "solution": "The type of irony used in the passage is situational irony. Situational irony occurs when there is a stark contrast between what is expected to happen and what actually happens. In this case, the renowned artist is expected to lead a life that mirrors the vibrancy and optimism depicted in his paintings. However, the reality is quite the opposite; he lives a life of solitude and melancholy. This irony contributes to the overall theme by highlighting the disparity between appearance and reality. It underscores the idea that outward expressions or public personas can often mask an individual's true feelings and personal struggles, adding depth and complexity to the character and the narrative."}], "Intermediate": [{"problem": "Rearrange the following sentence to make a grammatically correct sentence: 'the quickly brown fox jumps over lazy the dog.'", "answer": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", "solution": "To solve this problem, first identify the subject, verb, and object in the sentence.

Then, the length of the rectangle is '2w' units. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is given by: Perimeter = 2(length + width). Substituting the given values, we have: 36 = 2(2w + w).

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we solve 3x^2 - 12x + 11 = 0. Using the quadratic formula x = [12 \u00b1 sqrt(144 - 132)] / 6, we get x = 1 and x = 3 as the solutions. These are the critical points. To classify them, we examine the second derivative f''(x) = 6x - 12. Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points: f''(1) = -6 (indicating a local maxima), f''(3) = 6 (indicating a local minima), and at x = 2, the second derivative doesn't change sign (indicating a saddle point). Thus, the critical points are 1 (local maxima), 2 (saddle point), and 3 (local minima)."}]}, "History": {"Advanced": [{"problem": "Trace the political and economic impacts of the Treaty of Versailles on Germany and Europe from 1919 through the rise of the Nazi Party in 1933.

This led to hyperinflation and economic instability, severely affecting the German economy. Politically, the treaty caused widespread discontent among the German population, who viewed it as a 'Diktat' and a national humiliation. Territorial losses, including the Saar Basin, Alsace-Lorraine, and colonies, further weakened Germany. The League of Nations, intended to maintain peace, proved ineffective in addressing these grievances. The economic hardships and nationalistic fervor created fertile ground for extremist movements. By exploiting public dissatisfaction and promising to restore Germany's former glory, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained significant support, ultimately leading to their rise to power in 1933."}]}, "Art": {"Advanced": [{"problem": "Create a monochromatic painting that uses various shades, tints, and tones of a single color to depict an abstract scene conveying the concept of 'solitude'.

A secondary dominant is a dominant seventh chord that resolves to a diatonic chord other than the tonic. In this progression, A7 is the V7 of D major, but it also functions as the V7 of vi (Bm) since Bm is the relative minor of D major. Thus, A7 can be considered a secondary dominant (V7/vi) when it resolves to Bm, which it does in this progression.
